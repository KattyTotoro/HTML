        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
        applications.<br>

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia
        web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
        appearance
        of the document.<br>

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by
        denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt;
        directly introduce
        content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may
        include
        other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.

        <h2>Markup</h2>

        HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs
        like
        &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;.
        The first tag in such
        a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).<br>

        Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.<br>

        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:

        <pre>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;

            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;

            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;

        &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
