      <h1>William Shakespeare</h1>
      <hr>
      <address class="adress-decor">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</address>

      <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely
        regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called
        England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of
        approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
        authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than
        those of any other playwright.
      </p>
      <p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
        Hathaway,
        with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a
        successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord
        Chamberlain's
        Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he
        died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable
        speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the
        works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately
        note
        that few records survive of most commoners of the period.
      </p>
      <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and
        histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly
        tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in
        the
        English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
        collaborated
        with other playwrights.
      </p>
      <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
        However,
        in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more
        definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
        included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson
        presciently
        hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".
      </p>
      <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by
        new
        movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted
        through various cultural and political contexts around the world.
